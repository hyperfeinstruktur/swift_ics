## This directory contains versions of the ic scripts that don't write .hdf5 files but simply output .pkl files of the relevant quantities (pos,vel,mass) to be then written to hdf5 via some wrapper (see /old/)

** These scripts are no longer maintained and are not necessarily up to date wrt the main ones in the root dir**
